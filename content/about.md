Imagine a  world where advertisement screens are controlled by the people. A world where community-approved content dominates the public digital spaces. What would see on the display?

AdaCast is the digital infrastructure that allows content to be adapted to the local needs. Anyone can submit their content, while the community up/down votes it.

AdaCast-enabled displays can be used for :
* Post or request goods or service (bulletin board) 
* Track mutual credit between citizens
* display Art by local artist
* Show Important messages (eg: missing kids)
* Share Communal news and events
* Showcase an interactive blueprint of a proposal for the square renovation
* adding your service, and let the community decide!
